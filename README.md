## Inspiration
After countless planning meetings where action items were lost in lengthy transcripts or buried in team notes, we realized the process of converting conversations into user stories was both manual and inefficient. We asked: **What if we could automate that?** That's how *Teams to Stories* was born ‚Äî a tool to streamline sprint planning and bring productivity back to developers.

## What it does
**Teams to Stories** automatically transforms Microsoft Teams meeting transcripts into structured, reviewable user stories for Azure DevOps.  
Users simply input a Teams meeting ID, and the app:

1. Fetches the meeting transcript
2. Stores it in Azure Cosmos DB
3. Triggers an Azure Function that processes the transcript using Azure OpenAI
4. Presents the AI-generated user stories in a clean UI for human review
5. Upon approval, exports the stories directly to Azure DevOps Boards

It bridges the gap between discussion and execution ‚Äî in just minutes.

## How we built it
- **Frontend**: Built with React and hosted on **Azure Static Web Apps**, the UI allows users to input a Teams meeting ID, review stories, and export them.
- **Backend & Pipeline**:
  - **Microsoft Graph API**: Fetches meeting transcripts based on the Teams ID.
  - **Azure Cosmos DB**: Stores transcripts and triggers processing via **Change Feed**.
  - **Azure Functions**: Automatically handle transcript-to-user-story conversion using **Azure OpenAI**.
  - **Azure DevOps REST API**: Sends approved stories to the user‚Äôs sprint backlog.
- **AI Layer**: We used **Azure OpenAI GPT-4** with structured prompts to extract key points and format them into clean, actionable user stories.
- **Development Acceleration**: **GitHub Copilot** played a major role in writing API integrations, function triggers, and even UI logic.

---

## Challenges we ran into
- **Transcript Access**: Integrating with Microsoft Graph API and handling permissions for Teams transcripts was more complex than expected.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Getting consistent and high-quality user stories required multiple iterations of prompt design and output parsing.
- **Change Feed Syncing**: Ensuring Cosmos DB triggered the function pipeline without duplication or race conditions took careful testing.
- **Balancing Automation and Control**: We wanted speed, but also human oversight ‚Äî adding the review step while keeping UX smooth was key.

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- A **fully functional, end-to-end solution** that goes from Teams transcript to DevOps backlog with real AI and cloud automation.
- Implemented a **human-in-the-loop review interface** to ensure quality and safety of generated content.
- Created a **scalable architecture** using Azure-native tools like Cosmos DB, Functions, and Static Web Apps.
- Used **GitHub Copilot** productively throughout development, especially for rapid API prototyping and UI logic.

---

## What we learned
- How to build a **modular, event-driven system** with Cosmos DB Change Feed and Azure Functions.
- The importance of **prompt tuning** in AI pipelines to produce reliable, useful results.
- How to balance **automation and human review** in real-world use cases.
- The power of **Copilot** as a development accelerator and idea generator, especially in a fast-paced hackathon setting.

## What's next for Teams Meetings to Azure DevOps User Stories
We‚Äôre excited about taking Teams to Stories even further:

- **Microsoft Teams App Integration**: Users will soon be able to trigger story generation *from directly inside Teams* using a bot or meeting app.
- **Multiple Meeting Support**: Extend the app to batch process and manage user stories across multiple meetings.
- **Custom AI Models**: Let teams train models on their own backlog history for even more personalized story formatting.
- **Slack + Jira Support**: Expand the ecosystem to support more collaboration tools beyond Teams and Azure DevOps.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Show metrics like story turnaround time, coverage, and team engagement from meeting to sprint.
